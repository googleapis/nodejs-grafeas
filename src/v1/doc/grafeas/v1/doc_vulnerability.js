 * A security vulnerability that can be found in resources.
 *
 * @property {number} cvssScore
 *   The CVSS score of this vulnerability. CVSS score is on a scale of 0 - 10
 *   where 0 indicates low severity and 10 indicates high severity.
 *
 * @property {number} severity
 *   The note provider assigned severity of this vulnerability.
 *
 *   The number should be among the values of [Severity]{@link grafeas.v1.Severity}
 *
 * @property {Object[]} details
 *   Details of all known distros and packages affected by this vulnerability.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Detail]{@link grafeas.v1.Detail}
 *
 * @property {Object} cvssV3
 *   The full description of the CVSSv3 for this vulnerability.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [CVSSv3]{@link grafeas.v1.CVSSv3}
 *
 * @property {Object[]} windowsDetails
 *   Windows details get their own format because the information format and
 *   model don't match a normal detail. Specifically Windows updates are done as
 *   patches, thus Windows vulnerabilities really are a missing package, rather
 *   than a package being at an incorrect version.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [WindowsDetail]{@link grafeas.v1.WindowsDetail}
 *
 * @property {Object} sourceUpdateTime
 *   The time this information was last changed at the source. This is an
 *   upstream timestamp from the underlying information source - e.g. Ubuntu
 *   security tracker.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Timestamp]{@link google.protobuf.Timestamp}

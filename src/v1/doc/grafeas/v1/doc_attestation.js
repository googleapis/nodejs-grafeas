/**
 * Note kind that represents a logical attestation "role" or "authority". For
 * example, an organization might have one `Authority` for "QA" and one for
 * "build". This note is intended to act strictly as a grouping mechanism for
 * the attached occurrences (Attestations). This grouping mechanism also
 * provides a security boundary, since IAM ACLs gate the ability for a principle
 * to attach an occurrence to a given note. It also provides a single point of
 * lookup to find all attached attestation occurrences, even if they don't all
 * live in the same project.
 *
 * @property {Object} hint
 *   Hint hints at the purpose of the attestation authority.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Hint]{@link grafeas.v1.Hint}
 *
 * @typedef AttestationNote

  /**
   * This submessage provides human-readable hints about the purpose of the
   * authority. Because the name of a note acts as its resource reference, it is
   * important to disambiguate the canonical name of the Note (which might be a
   * UUID for security purposes) from "readable" names more suitable for debug
   * output. Note that these hints should not be used to look up authorities in
   * security sensitive contexts, such as when looking up attestations to
   * verify.

   *   Required. The human readable name of this attestation authority, for

/**
 * Occurrence that represents a single "attestation". The authenticity of an
 * attestation can be verified using the attached signature. If the verifier
 * trusts the public key of the signer, then verifying the signature is
 * sufficient to establish trust. In this circumstance, the authority to which
 * this attestation is attached is primarily useful for lookup (how to find
 * this attestation if you already know the authority and artifact to be
 * verified) and intent (for which authority this attestation was intended to
 * sign.
 *
 * @property {Buffer} serializedPayload
 *   Required. The serialized payload that is verified by one or more
 *   `signatures`.
 *
 * @property {Object[]} signatures
 *   One or more signatures over `serialized_payload`.  Verifier implementations
 *   should consider this attestation message verified if at least one
 *   `signature` verifies `serialized_payload`.  See `Signature` in common.proto
 *   for more details on signature structure and verification.
